# TESTING French Pastry online shop "Un delice"

Checked the validity of the code with [HTML Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and there were no errors.

However with the code of the [order page](https://github.com/yuyu78/pastry-online-shop/blob/master/order.html), there is a warning about using the heading element h2-h6 to the sections.

Instead of section, the semantic div was replaced so that there is no warning.
