## A French pastry online shop "Un Delice"

This project aims to create a website for a French pastry shop, located in Dublin. The business is selling 2 types of product:
* **the patisserie**: the general French pastries (ex: Mille-Feuille, Eclair)
* **the viennoiserie**: it is a category of pastry, a mix between pastry and bakery (ex: croissant, pain au chocolat).

The design of the website is simple and clear so that the customer can navigate and read easily all the information on each different page. The customer can choose between two options to receive the order: collection at store or delivery.

### Structure plane <a name="structure-plane"></a>

#### Home
On the home page on the top, to make a first good impression, it has a full-width image with a minimal sentence in the middle so that the website is more catchy and compelling.  
Underneath, an input for an email address with a subscribe button. For the marketing aim, the business wants to offer free delivery on the first order. When the user clicks on the subscribe button, a modal message will display with the option to receive marketing communication if the user wants.   
Below, there is a brief description of the patisserie and viennoiserie.  
In the end, a brief explanation about the delivery.

#### Our product (2 pages)
By clicking on **our product** in the navbar, it displays two option clickables: the patisserie and viennoiserie and will load the page selected.
The layout of these two pages is the same. The list of the product will be displayed in three columns on a desktop, and Ipad pro.
On a mobile device and Ipad, it will show two columns.
In each product, there will be the image, the price, the flavor, taste, and the allergen.

#### Order online
On the top of this page, an explanation about the ordering process and collection, delivery option.

Underneath, a form of the order details: 
* In the first part, the details of the customer.
* In the second part, an input number beside the name of the product to select the amount. 
Under the patisserie and viennoiserie, a link to direct to the list of the product page into the new browser.
So if the customer doesnÂ´t remember how the product looks like, by clicking on the link, the customer can check again to be sure about the product selected.
* At the end of the form, the customer has to select between the collection or delivery options. 
Both options contain hidden div, so if the customer selects the delivery option, it will appear the date, time, and address to fill out. If the collection option is selected, it only appears the date and time to choose.

When the customer will confirm the order, it will display a modal message. By clicking on the button "close" of the modal, it will redirect to the home page.

#### Our store
On this page, one picture of the shop and one picture of the pastry chef. Under the picture of the pastry chef, a brief explanation about this chef and the shop.
Above, it displays a google map with the address of the shop including the opening hours.

[Confirmation order](https://github.com/yuyu78/pastry-online-shop/blob/master/wireframe/confirmation-order.pdf)

At the beginning of the project, the plan was to create a confirmation order page separately when the customer submits the order but because Javascript is needed, instead, a modal message has been used so that when the customer clicks on "confirm order", it will display the modal message for the confirmation purchase.

#### Color Scheme
The main colors of the website are: 
* White
* Beige for the background color of the navbar and footer
* Orange-brown for the name of the brand "Un Delice"

For the pastry website, the choice of these colors is  justified by easier and clear navigation for the customer and highlight the products.

#### Typography 
* **Poppins** in all the page in general
* **Parisienne** for the name of the shop
* **Crimson Pro** for the navbar 
* **Alegreya** at the end on the footer on "French Pastry"

### Inspiration
* The layout of the homepage is inspired by the pastry site [Dolcesicily](https://shop.dolcesicily.ie/)  and [Thundersbakery](https://thundersbakery.ie/). Both homepages of these two websites start with a hero image with full width. On the website of [Dolcesicily](https://shop.dolcesicily.ie/), the idea of one picture and one paragraph in each row was taken to explain clearly the patisserie and viennoiserie.
* Inspired from the README and TESTING file template of [Anna Gilhespy](https://github.com/AJGreaves/portrait-artist)
* Inspired from the template of [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME)
* The information about the products was found on Wikipedia.
