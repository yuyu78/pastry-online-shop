## A French pastry online shop "Un Delice"

The aim of this project is to create a website of French pastry shop, located in Dublin.
The business is selling 2 types of product:
* **the patisserie**: the general French pastries (ex: Mille-Feuille, Eclair)
* **the viennoiserie**: it is a category of pastry, a mix between pastry and bakery (ex: croissant, pain au chocolat).

The design of the website is simple and clear so that the customer can navigate and read easily all the informations in each different page.
The customer can choose between two options to receive the order: collection at store or delivery.
